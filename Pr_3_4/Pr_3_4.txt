Pr.3-4
Create a class called ConnectionManager that
manages a fixed array of Connection objects.
The client programmer must not be able to
create Connection objects, but only get them
via a static method in ConnectionManager.
ConnectionManager returns a null reference when
it runs out of objects. Test the classes in main().

Class Connection has the next functionality:
-	has a counter of instances
-	automatically generates new id for a new connection
-	has method toString()
-	has method doSomething()

Make a ConnectionManager to be instantiated only once.

Use a Singleton programming paradigm.

Check list
- Define a private static attribute in the “single instance” class. 
- Define a public static accessor function in the class. 
- Do “lazy initialization” (creation on first use) in the accessor function. 
- Define all constructors to be protected or private.

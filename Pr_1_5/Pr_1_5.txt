Pr1-5
Write a program with two constant values, one
with alternating binary ones and zeroes, with
a zero in the least-significant digit, and the
second, also alternating, with a one in the
least-significant digit. Combine
these two values every way possible using the
bitwise operators. Display the results using
Integer.toBinaryString().

Hint: It's easiest to use hexadecimal constants for this.
